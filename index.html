I began to polish my technological skills in 2015 with my acceptance to the University at Albany. Since then I've amassed many skills that I can use to assist others both within and outside of a professional setting. I am a member of several on-campus clubs, including <span>IEEE</span> (the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) and Base64 (An on campus club that holds various I.T sessions and hackathons).</p>

In addition to on-campus clubs classes and assignments, I seek out and enjoy using additional material and resources to better my skills as a <span>programmer</span> and an innovator. I'm always willing to learn something new in the tech field and I'm always willing to lend a helping hand to those in need whether it be from debugging a thousand lines of code, to simply giving my opinion on a project! </p>
